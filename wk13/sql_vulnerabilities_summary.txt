1. When you type in Ben in the input field, the table displays nothing. This is expected as the query returns
matching values as well as values that are active. The user Ben has active = 0 meaning it won't be displayed

2. When you input "Ben'-- " the table returns a single row with the user Ben. This is unexpected because the website
is displaying an inactive user. The input value was able to break the query and return a record it shouldn't be able to.
Perhaps commenting out SQL code to wipe the parameter query.

3. When typing "Benâ€™ or 1=1" into the input field the table returns an empty table.

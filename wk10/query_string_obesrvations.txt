1.) When entering a valid word the website loads a page with the information related to the
query string being displayed on the screen. The URL of the website also as the query string in the parameters meaning that this search form used a GET request

2.) Entering an invalid word has the website load a page indicating no results found for the entered query string. Additionally the URL for the website no longer has /browse followed by the query string but instead has /misspelling
followed by the query string instead. Website likely redirects user to different page after validating string

3.) The website redirected but instead of a no results found page, it returned a page with a prompt stating 'results for <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>'. Additionally in the URL it displays /noresult instead of /misspelling
or /browse. This indicates that this page is used for invalid results or non word queries. 

4.) The result seems to be the same as the previous query but it displayed less information
